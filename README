This scripts provides two functionalities that use the iskeyword setting of
the current buffer.

The following mappings are provided for moving keywords in normal mode:

    <C-Up>   : exchange the current keyword with the previous one.
    <C-Down> : exchange the current keyword with the next one.

These mappings can be changed by changing the value of the following variables.

    let g:keywords_MoveWordL = '<C-Up>'
    let g:keywords_MoveWordR = '<C-Down>'

Also there exists mappings for adding/deleting "quotes" to/from a keyword or a
visually selected area. The mappings are as follows:

   qw, q"  : double quote
   qs, q'  : single quote
   qe, q`  : quote execute
   q[, q]  : quote with square brackets
   q{, q}  : quote with brackets
   q(, q)  : quote with parantheses
   q<, q>  : quote with xml style tag.

If you wish to provide a different map leader than 'q' use this variable:

   let g:keywords_MapLeader = 'q'

There is one normal mode mapping for removing quotes from a keyword:

   wq  :  removes non iskeyword material around the current keyword.
